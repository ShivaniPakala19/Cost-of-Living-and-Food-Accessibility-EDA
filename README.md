# Cost-of-Living-and-Food-Accessibility-EDA
This project investigates regional food cost disparities using Python-based EDA techniques. Leveraging libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, it uncovers patterns in affordability, visualizes pricing trends, and highlights socio-economic insights.

## 📌 Objective

- Analyze the cost of food items across different countries and regions.
- Visualize food price trends and affordability indicators.
- Identify patterns and outliers in cost of living related to food.
- Support policy or business decisions with data-driven insights.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `FAOSTAT_data_en_12-8-2024_sak.csv` – Raw dataset containing food price and economic indicators.
- `Cost_of_living_Food_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- `pandas` – Data manipulation
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – Static visualizations
- `plotly` – Interactive charts
- `numpy` – Numerical operations

## 📊 Key Insights

- Certain regions show significantly higher food prices despite lower income levels.
- Price volatility for staples like cereals and dairy is observed in specific regions.
- The affordability index reveals economic pressure in lower-income countries.
